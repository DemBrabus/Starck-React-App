Stark

Modern Website for Starck - An Innovative Office Chair Design Firm and Manufacture.
    
    Build: React.js
    - I wanted this site to be a single page Web App
    - I find that a component based architecture is very effective and more intuitive to build with and maintain later on.
    - I also want to continue to improve my skills and knowledge in working with React. 
  For these reasons I found that choosing React to build this site was a solid choice. 
    
    
* This Web App is for Demonstration purposes only *
    - this app is intended to demonstarte my ability to create a modern, functional and scalable web app using a javascript              framework,
    - Some features on the app are not operational due to my lack of backend knowledge,
    - The majority of the assets used were aquired from Steelcase.com, 
    - Images have been retouched and fitted for this Web App.
